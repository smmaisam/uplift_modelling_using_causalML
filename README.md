Introduction

This project showcases Uplift Modeling using the CausalML library. Uplift modeling, also known as treatment effect modeling, estimates the incremental impact of a treatment (e.g., marketing campaigns, new product features) on individual outcomes. Unlike traditional machine learning models that predict outcomes, uplift models help in identifying which individuals are most likely to respond to a treatment, allowing for targeted decision-making.

Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

- Implement Uplift Modeling to predict treatment effects at an individual level.
- Explore tree based modeling approaches.
- Evaluate model performance using Uplift and Qini curves.
- Use CausalML to ensure interpretability and transparency in uplift modeling.
